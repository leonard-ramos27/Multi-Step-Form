## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - CSS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

This is my first attempt at using Typescript and it was very confusing at first but it definitely helped with ensuring consistency across codes and avoiding possible issues. I was also able to try React hooks like useRef as well as creating custom hooks.

### Useful resources

- [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) - This helped me with the concepts on ReactJS such as creating components and managing state and props.
- [Multistep Form Custom Hook With React And TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDCBSnWkuH0) - This tutorial was a huge help when I was starting this project. I was able to learn how to create custom hooks as well as using typescript from this tutorial.
- [Deploying Vite App to Github Pages](https://medium.com/@aishwaryaparab1/deploying-vite-deploying-vite-app-to-github-pages-166fff40ffd3) - This helped me with the steps on deploying the app using Github Pages.
